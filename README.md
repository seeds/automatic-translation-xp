# Automatic Translation App

Automatic Translation App makes it easy for editors to translate into many popular languages by providing a Widget for this. Translation is made using Google's Cloud Translation API. Both plain text and HTML markup are supported. 

## Setup
### Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seeds/automatic-translation-xp.git
cd automatic-translation-xp
./gradlew clean build
```

### Installation

Install the application and add it to your site. A valid API Key from Google Cloud then needs to be defined in the app settings in order to use the Widget.

## License and credits

A license is required to use this application. Once the app is installed, the Widget will be blocked until a license is provided.

You can contact [Seeds](https://www.seeds.no/) to request a license. If a valid license is not found in the system, it can be installed by clicking the button `Upload license` in the Widget.
